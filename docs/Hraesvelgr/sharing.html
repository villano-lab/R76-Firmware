<h1>Sharing This Device</h1>

<p>
Because this is a shared device, here are a few tips:
</p>

<p>
<b>Don't store passwords or keys on this computer.</b> 
A small handful of logins are stored on this computer, 
but they are all logins that are intended to be shared among all possible users. 

If you are comfortable storing your personal logins on this machine despite the warning,
you can create and launch a Firefox profile in <a href="about:profiles">about:profiles</a>
so that you can stay logged in without anyone else accidentally using your accounts.

If you wish to use an SSH key on this computer or on the Linux machine, 
you can generate one with a non-default name (for example, not `id_rsa`) 
and password-protect the key.

</p>

<p>
<b>Don't use the SSH key for personal access.</b>
There is an SSH key on this computer, 
which is provided only to access the associated Linux machine. 
If you use it for any kind of personal use, 
such as as a GitHub access key,
anyone else using this computer will be able to use your account as well.
