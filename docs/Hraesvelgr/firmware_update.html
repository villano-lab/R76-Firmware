<h1>Updating DT5560SE Firmware and Software</h1>

<h2>0. First-time setup</h2>
<a href="#s1">Skip</a>
<p>
If you have not cloned the R76-Firmware repository on both the Windows and Linux machines yet, 
you will need to do so now. </p>

<h3>Clone to Windows</h3>
Start by opening the GitHub Desktop application, pinned to the Start menu, 
to clone to Windows. 
In the upper left corner, there is a dropdown labeled "Current Repository: Repositoryname."</p>

<img src="images/currentrepo.png" alt="The upper left corner of the GitHub Desktop app, as altribed above." />

<p>Select this, then use the "Add" dropdown to select "Clone repository..."</p>

<img src="images/clone.png" alt="Under the now-selected 'Current repository' menu, there is a dropdown on the right of the top row of the sub-menu labeled 'Add.' This has been selected, and the first option, 'Clone repository...', has been selected." />

<p>In the cloning menu, select the "URL" tab 
and provide <code>https://github.com/villano-lab/R76-Firmware</code> in the first box,
then hit "Clone."</p>

<img src="images/cloneurl.png" alt="A popup appears named 'Clone a repository' appears within the application. There is a row of tabs beneath the title; 'URL' has been selected. Just below this are two text-entry fields. The first now says 'https://github.com/villano-lab/R76-Firmware'. The second is unchanged from the default. Beneath these is a 'Clone' button to the left of a 'Cancel' button." />

<p>The repository will begin cloning itself to the local machine.<br/>

Once you've cloned the (much cleaner) R76 repository, 
you may wish to update the path of the "Help" bookmark in Firefox 
to use this repository to use this repository instead of the old one.
You can access the bookmarks manager using <code>ctrl+shift+O</code>.
Navigate to "Bookmarks Toolbar", "Help", 
then change <code>NaI_Array_Firmware</code> in the path to <code>R76-Firmware</code>.</p>

<h3>Clone to Linux</h3>
<p>Start by launching PowerShell from the Start menu. Once it is open, enter the command:</p>

<p><code>ssh middy</code></p>

<p>You are now controlling the Linux machine. 
From here, switch to the <code>packages</code> directory:</p>

<p><code>cd packages</code></p>

<p>Then clone the repository.</p>

<p><code>git clone https://github.com/villano-lab/R76-Firmware</code></p>

<p>Once the repository is cloned, 
you can exit the remote session with the command <code>exit</code> 
or by simply closing the PowerShell window.</p>

<h2 id="s1">1. Update local copy of the repository</h2>
<p>To pull all updates to the firmware and source files for software, 
fetch and pull updates for `R76-Firmware` from GitHub. <br/>
Launch GitHub Desktop from the Start menu, 
then make sure that you are currently looking at the <code>R76-Firmware</code> repository
(indicated at the far left of the top bar). Once you are,
use the "fetch" button on the right side of the top bar to check for remote changes.</p>

<img src="images/fetchorigin.png" alt="The top bar of the GitHub Desktop menu. The leftmost button is a dropdown which reads 'Current repository: NaI_Array_Firmware'. The rightmost button, labeled 'Fetch Origin,' is highlighted." />

<p>If, after fetching, there are any new changes to be downloaded, the fetch button will change:</p>

<img src="images/pull.png" alt="The same button as above has now become 'Pull origin.'" />

<h2>2. Find and flash the firmware file.</h2>
<p>Each firmware directory within the <code>R76-firmware</code> repository should contain a flashable firmware file. 
This file is named <code>projectname.fpga</code> &ndash; for example, <code>Na22Trigger.fpga</code>. 
To flash the firmware to the DT5560SE, in the Home ribbon in SCI-Compiler, use the "Flash Program Tool" function.</p>

<img src="images/sciflashribbon.png" alt="The home ribbon in the top bar of SCI-Compiler. 'Flash Program Tool' has been highlighted toward the right." />

<p>When prompted, select the correct device (DT5560) from the dropdown menu 
and supply the appropriate IP address (134.84.150.42).</p>

<img src="images/flashtoolconnect.png" alt="A menu that I don't actually have a picture of yet because SCI-Compiler broke itself." />

<p>Once connected, select the firmware file you want to upload. 
When finished, the DT5560SE will automatically reboot itself into the new firmware.</p>

<h2>3. Build the SDK</h2>
<p>Within each firmware directory is a `library` subdirectory. 
The C programs provided here currently can only be built on the Linux machine, 
so start by running <code>ssh middy</code> to connect. 
Navigate to the directory containing the C code SDK for firmware <code>firmwarename</code>:
</p>

<p><code>cd ~/packages/R76-Firmware/firmwarename/library/C/lib</code></p>

<p>And run the command</p>

<p><code>make</code></p>

<h2>4. Compile the programs</h2>

<p>Once the SDK for your firmware is built, 
you can run the compilation for programs associated with the firmware.
Assuming you are still at the location we left off in at the last step 
(<code>middy:~/packages/R76-Firmware/firmwarename/library/C/lib/</code>)
you can run the command:</p>

<p><code>bash compile.sh</code></p>

<p>All compiled programs can now be run from within this directory.</p>
