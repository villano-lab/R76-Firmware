#Lines beginning with a # are a comment. In-line comments are not yet supported.
#All parameters will be passed into setregisters if possible.
#Parameters that can't be used by a program (e.x. the range parameter) will be ignored by other programs.
#Note that the behavior resulting from combining a config file and command line arguments for the same parameters is currently undefined.
#Extra whitespace between arguments is ignored, but please terminate all lines with newline.
