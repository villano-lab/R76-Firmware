<h1> Using CoMPASS </h1>

<p>
Our main use for CoMPASS is gain matching. 
Voltages are set in GECO and the detector outputs at these voltages can be verified in CoMPASS.

</p>

<p><u>Matched Voltages</u><br/>
The below voltages are gain-matched to center the Potassium line at bin 250.

<h2> Calibration Using CoMPASS </h2>

<h3> Connect to CAEN HV Unit </h3>

<p>
Start by launching GECO (pinned to start). 
It will prompt you for an IP address; this is <code>134.84.150.53</code>. 
The username and password are both <code>admin</code>.
</p>

<p>
In order to enable the channels (turn from red to green), 
you have to set up the interlock with the module on the backside of the CAEN HV unit.
This is a small cylindrical "cap" that goes on the back of the unit.
</p>

<p>
Once the channels are online, you can swtich one (or many) on. 
It will turn green and ramp up.
</p>

<h3> Running CoMPASS </h3>

<p>
Open CoMPASS and select new or existing project. 
(On this machine, the calibration is under the 'Documents' folder.)
Then, select "Scan," which should automatically connect to the digitizer.
</p>

<h3> Acquisition Tab </h3>

<p> Now that you are in the main menu, set the run ID to 
<code>NaI-Array-Detector#-#V-Bknd-Datetaken</code> and check that the file format is set to "root".<br/>
Checkmark the following settings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>raw data (optional - raw data is large so don't mark this unless you need it)</li>
	<li>save filtered data</li>
	<li>save unfiltered data</li>
	<li>save calibrated data</li>
	<li>save spectra on stop acquisition</li>
	<li>energy</li>
	
<h3> Settings Tab </h3>
<p>In the input tab:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Set "Record length" to 5000 (this will round itself to 4992).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the discriminator tab:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Set "threshold" to 27</li>
</ul>

<p>In the synchronization tab:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Set "start mode" to <code>software (asynchronous)</code>
	<li>Set "TRG OUT/GPO Mode" to <code>Level 0</code>
</ul>

<h3> To collect Data </h3>

<ol>
	<li>Select the plot picture at the right end of the upper toolbar.</li>
	<li>In the new window, select "new energy histogram" on the left side of the toolbar. This should generate a blank plot.</li>
	<li>Click the play button to begin data collection with the detector that is plugged into the desktop digitizer. The plot will periodically update until the run is complete.</li>
	<li>When the run is over, you can save an image of the plot using the camera icon or save the data using the floppy disk icon.</li>
</ol>
